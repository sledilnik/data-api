# slo-covid-19 rest-server
Provides REST API to data collected in [csv files](https://github.com/slo-covid-19/data). The sources are [stats](https://covid19.rthand.com/api/stats), 
[regions](https://covid19.rthand.com/api/regions), [patients](https://covid19.rthand.com/api/patients), 
[hospitals](https://covid19.rthand.com/api/hospitals), [hospitals-list](https://covid19.rthand.com/api/hospitals-list), 
[municipalities-list](https://covid19.rthand.com/api/municipalities-list), [regions-pivot](https://covid19.rthand.com/api/regions-pivot), 
[retirement-homes](https://covid19.rthand.com/api/retirement-homes), [rretirement-homes-list](https://covid19.rthand.com/api/retirement-homes-list) and 
[deceased-regions](https://covid19.rthand.com/api/deceased-regions).
Only GET method is supported, no parameters are available. If necessary filtering parameters will be added eventually.

A running instance is available at https://covid19.rthand.com/api/ endpoint.

Current Docker container for this project is available at [mihamarkic/slo-covid19-server](https://hub.docker.com/r/mihamarkic/slo-covid19-server).

Response compression is supported, ETag/If-None-Match as well.

Swagger endpoint is at [https://covid19.rthand.com/swagger](https://covid19.rthand.com/swagger).

In case of failures a notification is set to slack channel #alert through Data API bot defined by a secret (see sample docker-compose file below).
